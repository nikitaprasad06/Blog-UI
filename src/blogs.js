        or indulge in a fantastic pizza. Of course the best pizzas are still to be had in Naples, but the Amalfi Coast certainly comes close enough to 
        some of the best pizza you will taste on your travels throughout Italy.The first restaurant I would recommend is also the first we visited, located right on the beach (immediately turn right as you pass through the two lion’s head statues); Le Tre Sorelle (The Three Sisters). Here is where you can enjoy traditional cuisine from the region and prices are surprisingly
         reasonable for the beachside location. The place really comes to life during the lunch rush (1-3pm) and late in the evenings.
         If you’re looking for something a little more swanky, then head over to Le Sirenuse Hotel and book yourself a table at Ristorante la Sponda; the hotel’s michelin star restaurant with service and food to match. Complete with fairy lighting, charming waiters and a menu to write home about,

There is also a “hop on hop off” bus that travels around the Amalfi for those who prefer to play up the tourist card, though if you feel confident on the roads we certainly 
        found the most enjoyable mode of transport to be a day vespa rental, which gave us the freedom to explore on our own time and plans.

       in the art of vacationing. This is the kind of island where you really can arrive, switch off, and unwind. Santorini is known for its crisp white wines and dessert wine known as Vinsanto. There are a handful of wineries who offer wine tasting and food for a small fee. 
       This can be a great way to get out of your hotel and explore more of the island.
       There are a few day tours on offer for visitors to Santorini, especially if you are interested in archaeology. 
       The most popular day tour visits caldera’s volcanic islands of Nea Kameni and Palia Kameni. You will visit the crater of one of the volcanoes, 
       and the hot springs of the other.`,

        So long as you walk the streets without rhyme or reason, make your way down to the characteristic black pebble beach, take note of the six senses when indulging in local,
         fresh cuisine and go out of your way to seek the perfect view, then really you have “seen” Positano. The rest will follow suit..`,

        label: "Where to eat",
        data: `Campania cuisine is rustic, hearty, and full of flavour. Being a coastal town, Positano features seafood heavily, 
        though for vegetarians you really can’t go past the delightful melanzane alla parmigana (eggplant parmigana), a personal favourite of mine, 
        or indulge in a fantastic pizza. Of course the best pizzas are still to be had in Naples, but the Amalfi Coast certainly comes close enough to 
        some of the best pizza you will taste on your travels throughout Italy.The first restaurant I would recommend is also the first we visited, located right on the beach (immediately turn right as you pass through the two lion’s head statues); Le Tre Sorelle (The Three Sisters). Here is where you can enjoy traditional cuisine from the region and prices are surprisingly
         reasonable for the beachside location. The place really comes to life during the lunch rush (1-3pm) and late in the evenings.
         If you’re looking for something a little more swanky, then head over to Le Sirenuse Hotel and book yourself a table at Ristorante la Sponda; the hotel’s michelin star restaurant with service and food to match. Complete with fairy lighting, charming waiters and a menu to write home about, 
         this is the perfect location for honeymooners and couple looking for a romantic night out.

        data: `Positano is a small beachside village quite literally built in to the cliff face. Thus you can expect plenty of stairs, steep inclines, and narrow streets that motorists share with pedestrians. The town is best seen on foot in order to really get a feel for the place, however if you plan to travel elsewhere in the Amalfi coast I would suggest either a scooter rental or public SITA bus as the easiest and most affordable ways to get around. There is also a “hop on hop off” bus that travels around the Amalfi for those who prefer to play up the tourist card, though if you feel confident on the roads we certainly 
        found the most enjoyable mode of transport to be a day vespa rental, which gave us the freedom to explore on our own time and plans.
        Ferries are another popular way to see the Amalfi Coast, particularly if travelling to the isle of Capri.
         You can also reach Positano by ferry from Capri and Sorrento, however you will find limited services on offer outside of the summer season..`,
